# Internet-Drafts

This repository contains a set of work-in-progress [IETF Internet-Drafts](https://www.ietf.org/standards/ids/). Each draft is in Markdown format. XML and text versions of these drafts, as required for [draft submission](https://datatracker.ietf.org/submit/) is accomplished using:

* [kramdown-rfc2629](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629/blob/master/README.md) to convert from Markdown to XML
* [xml2rfc](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/) to convert from XML to to text and other formats
* [IDNITS](https://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/) to verify the readiness of the resulting text version of the file for submission
* [Internet-draft submission](https://datatracker.ietf.org/submit/) to submit updated version
