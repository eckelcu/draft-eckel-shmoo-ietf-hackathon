# Introduction

IETF Hackathons encourage developers to collaborate and develop utilities, ideas, sample code and solutions that show practical implementations of IETF standards. 
IETF Hackathons aim to:

* Advance the pace and relevance of IETF standards activities by bringing the speed and collaborative spirit of open source development into the IETF
* Bring developers and young people into IETF and get them exposed to and interested in IETF

IETF Hackathons are free to attend and open to everyone. They are collaborative events, not competitions. 
This document provides a set of best practices for running IETF Hackathons.
