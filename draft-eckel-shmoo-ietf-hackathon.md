# Introduction

IETF Hackathons encourage developers to collaborate and develop utilities, ideas, sample code and solutions that show practical implementations of IETF standards. 
IETF Hackathons aim to:

* Advance the pace and relevance of IETF standards activities by bringing the speed and collaborative spirit of open source development into the IETF
* Bring developers and young people into IETF and get them exposed to and interested in IETF

IETF Hackathons are free to attend and open to everyone. They are collaborative events, not competitions. Any competitiveness among participants is friendly, and in the spirit of advancing the pace and relevance of new and evolving internet standards.

This document provides a set of best practices for running IETF Hackathons.

# Timing

The first IETF Hackathon was held the weekend before the start of the IETF 92 meeting. The rationale was to avoid conflicts yet make it relatively convenient for those attending the IETF meeeting to participate in the hackathon as well. Holding the hackathon on the weekend was also viewed as making it more accessible to non IETF meeting attendees, including students and working professionals who would have other committements during the week. The weekend before was viewed as better than the weekend after such that things learned during the hacakthon could be shared and discussed with the rest of the IETF community during working group sessions and the like. This worked well at IETF 92, was repeated at IETF 93, and quickly became an established norm with the IETF meeting being officially extended to include the hackathon at the start.

## Online Timing

IETF 107 Hackathon was originally scheduled to be the weekend at the start of the IETF meeting in Vancouver. When COVID-19 hit and it became clear the IETF meeting could not occur in person, the hackathon already had 23 projects and 176 registrations. With only 10 days until the anticipated start of the hackathon, a survey went out to the hackathon community, including all project champions and registered participants, to see if they wanted to participate in the hackathon exactly as planned except with everyone participating remotely rather than in person. A relatively small number of people expressed interest in participating, with even fewer wanting to continue to champion their projects. The fact that the hackathon was planned for the weekend before the IETF meeting and in the local time zone, both of which were historically very convenient and attractive to hackathon participants, suddenly became huge obstacles. Consequently, the IETF 107 Hackathon was cancelled.

We knew more advance that IETF 108 would be an online only meeting. We moved and expanded the schedule to run the entire work week before the rest of the IETF meeting. The hackathon kickoff was set for Monday, the closing for Friday, with all the time in between left for individual project teams to arrange to meet how and when was most convenient for them. The kickoff and closing sessions were schedule to align with the time frame established for the IETF 108 meeting. All of this was, of course, not ideal, and it worked much better for some people than for others, but at least everyone knew the plan and corresponding time commitment well in advance and had the ability to plan accordingly.

The response was great. We ultimately had 19 projects and almost 300 registrations. It is hard to say how many people actually participated and for how long, but many projects were able to get substantial work done. For the closing, 10 teams produced and shared presentations summarizing their findings and achievements. All presentations as well as the agenda and a recording of the closing session are available via the IETF 108 Hackathon [wiki]((https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ietf/meeting/wiki/109hackathon).
